- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?



i've worked with inheritance before briefly and my past experience made me a bit nervous about working with it now in java. but through this assignment, i feel a lot more comfortable and actually excited! i felt confident programming in this assignment and solving bugs and working in the different classes. i think inheritance definitely has big impact on programming and makes it so much easier because so often classes will have similar codes. inheritance allows things to be cleaner and less likely to have to fix so many bugs when working with so many lines of code. using the java documentation really worked for me for this assignment and helped me so much with figuring things out. advice i would give to people taking this course in the future would be to utilise the official documentation, i can't believe i haven't been using it as much as i could have with past assignments and will definitely use it more going forward.
